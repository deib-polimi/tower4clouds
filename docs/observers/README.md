#Observers

Observers can be attached using one of the following methods:
* [The Manager Webapp](../manager/webapp.md)
* [The Manager Rest API](../manager/rest-api/)
* [The Manager Java API](../manager/java-api.md)

Observers can be attached only to observable metrics, that is, metrics generated by means of the [*Output Metric*](../rules/actions/outputmetric.md) action of a [Rule](../rules/).

Possible observers are:

* [HistoryDB](rdf-history-db/)
* [Graphite](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
